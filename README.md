# High-Definition Image Enhancer

## Overview

This web application enhances low-resolution images by generating high-definition, super-resolved versions using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Traditional image upscaling methods often produce blurry or distorted results, but leveraging deep learning with SR-GANs yields sharper, more visually appealing images with greater detail and clarity.


## Dependencies

* ISR (Image Super-Resolution) Python library
* numpy
* Pillow (PIL)
* Streamlit (for the user interface)

## Getting Started

1. Install the required packages, ideally using a `requirements.txt` file.
2. Run the Streamlit app with the command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run application.py
   ```
